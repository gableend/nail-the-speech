# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

## üéØ Current Status
‚úÖ **Clerk Integration Completed**: All authentication components and middleware are installed and configured
‚ùå **Clerk Keys Missing**: Need real API keys from Clerk dashboard to test functionality

## üîë Required Setup Steps

### 1. Create Clerk Account & Application
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Sign up/Sign in to your Clerk account
3. Create a new application for "Nail The Speech"
4. Choose your preferred authentication providers (Email, Google, GitHub, etc.)

### 2. Get Your API Keys
Once your Clerk application is created:
1. Go to **API Keys** section in your Clerk dashboard
2. Copy the **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
3. Copy the **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

### 3. Update Environment Variables
Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Replace these placeholder values with your real Clerk keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here
```

### 4. Configure Authentication Settings (Optional)
In your Clerk dashboard, you can customize:
- **Sign-up/Sign-in pages**: Enable social providers, customize fields
- **User profiles**: Configure what user data to collect
- **Session settings**: Set session duration and security options
- **Webhooks**: Set up user event notifications (for advanced features)

## üöÄ What Works Once Keys Are Added

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented Features:
- **Authentication Flow**: Sign-up, sign-in, sign-out
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard requires authentication
- **User Context**: Access to user data in components
- **Database Integration**: Speeches are saved with user association
- **Navigation**: Different UI for authenticated vs anonymous users

### üéØ User Experience:
1. **Anonymous Users**: Can use generator and create speeches (saved anonymously)
2. **Authenticated Users**: Get personal dashboard with speech history
3. **Protected Pages**: Dashboard redirects to sign-in if not authenticated
4. **Seamless Integration**: UserButton for profile management and sign-out

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Protects `/dashboard/*` routes
- Allows anonymous access to generator and public pages

### Layout (`layout.tsx`)
- ClerkProvider wraps entire app
- Provides authentication context

### Navigation (`AuthNavigation.tsx`)
- Shows different buttons based on auth state
- Sign in/Sign up for anonymous users
- Dashboard/UserButton for authenticated users

### API Integration (`/api/generate-speech/route.ts`)
- Associates speeches with users when authenticated
- Falls back to anonymous storage for non-authenticated users

### Database Schema
- `userId` field in Speech model (nullable for anonymous speeches)
- `isCompleted` field for draft functionality

## üêõ Current Console Errors (Expected)
- `Clerk publishableKey is invalid`: Expected until real keys are added
- React hydration error #418: Known issue, doesn't affect functionality
- Font preload warnings: Minor optimization issue, doesn't affect functionality

## ‚ö° Next Steps After Keys Are Added
1. Test sign-up flow
2. Test sign-in flow
3. Test dashboard functionality
4. Test speech creation with user association
5. Test user speech history
6. Deploy to production with environment variables
