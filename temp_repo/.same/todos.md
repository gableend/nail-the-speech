## 🎯 CRITICAL CLERK MIDDLEWARE FIX - ✅ DEPLOYED TO MAIN

- [x] **DEPLOYED** - Fixed Clerk middleware location: moved from `./middleware.ts` to `./src/middleware.ts`
- [x] **DEPLOYED** - This resolves the server-side `auth()` failures that were causing dashboard issues
- [x] **DEPLOYED** - Version 104 committed and pushed to main branch
- [x] **DEPLOYED** - Netlify auto-deploy will build and deploy the fix automatically
- [x] **DEPLOYED** - The Clerk error "clerkMiddleware() was not run, middleware file might be misplaced" should now be resolved

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS - Testing on Production Domain

Now that the middleware fix is deployed, you should test the authentication flow on the production domain:

1. **Visit www.nailthespeech.com** (the production domain where Clerk is configured)
2. **Test sign-in flow** - Try logging in to see if dashboard access works
3. **Test dashboard** - Navigate to `/dashboard` after signing in to verify server-side auth works
4. **Verify the fix** - Check if you still see "Dashboard Temporarily Unavailable" or if it now loads properly

The issue was that Clerk is configured for the production domain `www.nailthespeech.com`, not localhost, so testing on the production domain is necessary to verify the middleware fix works correctly.
