# Authentication Cleanup - NextAuth to Clerk Migration

## Current Authentication Components to Remove:
- [x] NextAuth configuration files (API routes, types)
- [x] SessionProvider wrapper and component
- [x] Authentication middleware
- [x] Login/signup modals and forms (removed auth components)
- [x] Dashboard protected routes (removed dashboard)
- [x] User authentication hooks and utilities
- [x] Database session/account models (cleaned schema)
- [x] Pricing and result pages (removed for now)
- [x] Authentication dependencies from package.json

## Completed Clean Slate Tasks:
âœ… 1. Removed NextAuth dependencies (`next-auth`, `@auth/prisma-adapter`)
âœ… 2. Removed authentication components and pages
âœ… 3. Removed protected route logic from all pages
âœ… 4. Cleaned up database schema (removed NextAuth tables)
âœ… 5. Removed authentication-related API routes
âœ… 6. Made all pages publicly accessible
âœ… 7. Recreated clean database

## Current State:
- Home page: Clean, no auth dependencies
- Generator page: Clean, no auth dependencies
- API: Only generate-speech and env-check routes remain
- Database: Only Speech model (no user association)

## Ready for Clerk Implementation! ðŸŽ‰

The project is now in a clean state with no NextAuth remnants. All authentication-related code has been removed and the app runs without any auth dependencies.
